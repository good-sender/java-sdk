# ConsentEmailRecipient

Recipient envelope with optional display name. Pass this shape instead of a bare email string when you want the name to appear in the To header on the consent email and in subsequent listings.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**email** | **String** | Recipient email address. Leading and trailing whitespace are stripped server-side. |  |
|**name** | **String** | Optional display name. Pass a non-empty string to set or replace the stored name. Passing &#x60;null&#x60;, an empty string, or omitting the field on a re-submitted recipient leaves any previously-stored name unchanged — clearing must be done via the dashboard / authenticated edit flow.  |  [optional] |
